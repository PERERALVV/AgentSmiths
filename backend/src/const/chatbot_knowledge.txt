--- PAGE 56 ---
##### The Log In feature facilitates user authentication within the system. Upon initiating the Log In process, users are prompted to input their registered username and corresponding password. Subsequently, this data is transmitted to the backend server for validation against the stored user database.

##### Behind the scenes, a series of validation checks are performed. Firstly, the entered username is cross-referenced with the records in the user database. If the username provided does not correspond to any registered user, a signal is relayed to the frontend, signaling the invalidity of the username. Consequently, an informative message is displayed to the user, notifying them of the invalid entry.

##### Upon successful username validation, the system proceeds to verify the entered password against the associated account. Should the password provided fail to match the stored credentials, a signal is again transmitted to the frontend, indicating a mismatch. In such instances, users are prompted to re-enter the correct password or utilize the provided link to initiate the password recovery process, facilitating seamless user assistance.

##### This Log In functionality embodies a critical aspect of user interaction within the system, ensuring secure and efficient access to personalized accounts. Through meticulous design and implementation, it seamlessly integrates into the overarching system architecture, providing users with a streamlined authentication experience.

##### Sign Up Functionality:

##### The Sign Up feature enables new users to register and create accounts within the system. Upon initiating the Sign Up process, users are presented with a registration form where they are prompted to provide essential information such as a unique username, a valid email address, and a secure password.

##### Behind the scenes, the system conducts several validation checks to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the provided information. Firstly, the entered username is examined to ensure its uniqueness across the platform. If the chosen username is already in use, a signal is sent to the frontend, prompting the user to select an alternative username.

##### Following successful username validation, the system verifies the provided email address to ensure its validity and uniqueness within the system. If the email address is already associated with an existing account or if it does not meet the standard email format, an error message is relayed to the user, guiding them to input a valid and unique email address.

##### 56

--- PAGE 57 ---
##### Once the username and email address have been successfully validated, the system proceeds to assess the strength and security of the provided password. Password strength requirements, such as minimum length, inclusion of alphanumeric characters, and avoidance of common patterns, are enforced to enhance security.
