HUMAN_INTERVENTION_EXPLANATION="""
**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app youâ€™re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

LOGS_AND_ERROR_HANDLING="""
**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message.

"""

PROJECT_TASKS="""
Before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this {{ task_type }} into smaller tasks so that it is easier to develop, debug and make the {{ task_type }} work.

Each task needs to be related only to the development of this {{ task_type }} and nothing else - once the {{ task_type }} is fully working, that is it. There shouldn't be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, testing or anything that is not writing the actual code.

**IMPORTANT**
As an experienced tech lead you always follow rules on how to create tasks. Dividing project into tasks is extremely important job and you have to do it very carefully.

Now, based on the project details provided{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} and new feature description{% endif %}, think task by task and create the entire development plan{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} for new feature{% elif task_type  == 'app' %}. {% if files %}Continue from the existing code listed above{% else %}Start from the project setup{% endif %} and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working{% if files %}. You should not reimplement what's already done - just continue from the implementation already there{% endif %}{% endif %} while strictly following these rules:

Rule #1
There should never be a task that is only testing or ensuring something works, every task must have coding involved. Have this in mind for every task, but it is extremely important for last task of project. Testing if {{ task_type }} works will be done as part of each task.

Rule #2
This rule applies to the complexity of tasks.
You have to make sure the project is not split into tasks that are too small or simple for no reason but also not too big or complex so that they are hard to develop, debug and review.
Have in mind that project already has workspace folder created and only system dependencies installed. You don't have to create tasks for that.
Here are examples of poorly created tasks:

**too simple tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project and install all necessary dependencies.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection using Mongoose with the IP '127.0.0.1'.

**too complex tasks**
- Set up Node.js project with /home, /profile, /register and /login routes that will have user authentication, connection to MongoDB with user schemas, mailing of new users and frontend with nice design.

You must to avoid creating tasks that are too simple or too complex. You have to aim to create tasks that are medium complexity. Here are examples of tasks that are good:

**good tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project, install all necessary dependencies and set up an express server with a simple route to `/ping` that returns the status 200.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection and implement the message schema using Mongoose for persistent storage of messages.

Rule #3
This rule applies to the number of tasks you will create.
Every {{ task_type }} should have different number of tasks depending on complexity. Think task by task and create the minimum number of tasks that are relevant for this specific {{ task_type }}.{% if task_type  == 'feature' %} If the feature is small, it is ok to have only 1 task.{% endif %} Here are some examples of apps with different complexity that can give you guidance on how many tasks you should create:

Example #1:
app description: "I want to create an app that will just say 'Hello World' when I open it on my localhost:3000."
number of tasks: 1-2

Example #2:
app description: "Create a node.js app that enables users to register and log into the app. On frontend it should have /home (shows user data), /register and /login. It should use sessions to keep user logged in."
number of tasks: 2-4

Example #3:
app description: "A cool online shoe store, with a sleek look. In terms of data models, there are shoes, categories and user profiles. For web pages: product listing, details, shopping cart. It must look cool and jazzy."
number of tasks: 5-15

Rule #4
This rule applies to writing task 'description'.
Every task must have a clear and very detailed (must be minimum of 4 sentences but can be more) 'description'. It must be very clear so that even developers who just moved to this project can execute them without additional questions. It is not enough to just write something like "Create a route for /home". You have to describe what needs to be done in that route, what data needs to be returned, what should be the status code, etc. Give as many details as possible and make sure no information is missing that could be needed for this task.
Here is an example of good and bad task description:

**bad task**
{
    "description": "Create a route for /dashboard"
}

**good task**
{
    "description": "In 'route.js' add a route for /dashboard that returns the status 200. Route should be accessible only for logged in users. In 'middlewares.js' there should be a check if user is logged in using session. If user is not logged in, it should redirect to /login. If user is logged in, it should return the user data. User data should be fetched from database in 'users' collection using the user id from session."
}

Rule #5
When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.
Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).
"""

RELATIVE_PATHS="""
**IMPORTANT**: Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root.
 For example:
 - use `dirname/filename.py` instead of `/path/to/project/dirname/filename.py`
 - use `filename.js` instead of `./filename.js`
"""

SINGLE_QUESTION="""
**IMPORTANT**
Here are the instructions for Asking Additional Questions:

Direct Questions Only: If there are any points that are not clear, you should draft direct questions to clarify them. Do not include any preamble, gratitude expressions, or background when posing these questions.

Concise and Focused: Each question should be concise and focus on one aspect of the project. Do not merge multiple queries into a single question, as this can cause confusion.

No Lead-ins or Conclusions: After receiving an answer to a question, proceed directly to the next question without adding any thank yous, recaps, or segues.

Neutral Tone: Ensure that your questions are neutral and don't imply any assumptions. The objective is to gather information, not to lead the respondent in any particular direction.

Examples:
Instead of "Thank you for that information. My next question is: Should A be bigger than B?", simply ask "Should A be bigger than B?".
Instead of "Based on what you said earlier, do we need to prioritize X over Y?", just ask "Do we need to prioritize X over Y?".

Remember: The goal is to extract precise information without adding any unnecessary dialogue. Your questions should be straightforward and to the point.

I want your response to be only one question at a time. I will ask you again when I am ready for next question.

Ask maximum of {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions and after that I want you to respond with "{{END_RESPONSE}}".

If everything is clear before asking those {{MAX_QUESTIONS}} questions, you write the response in the following format:
"{{END_RESPONSE}}"

SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS="""
**IMPORTANT**
Here are the instructions for Writing the Summary:

1. **Stick to the Facts**: Every sentence should be informative and relevant. Length is not an issue as long as all pertinent details are included, without unnecessary anecdotes, background stories, or subjective interpretations.

2. **Avoid Subjectivity and Mentioning The Client or Any External Entities**: Do not mention phrases like "the client wants" or "the client said". Do not provide personal opinions, interpretations, or unnecessary background stories. Summarize information in a direct and neutral manner.

3. **Use Active Voice**: Use active rather than passive voice. For instance, "The project includes 5 subdomains" instead of "It was decided that the project should include 5 subdomains."

4. **Be Direct**: Replace indirect phrases with direct statements. For example, instead of saying "The client said there might be a need for...", state "There will be...".

5. **Prioritize Clarity**: Each statement should be clear and easy to understand. Refrain from using jargon unless it's widely recognized in the project's context.

6. **Organize Information**: Group related items to ensure a coherent flow in your summary, making it more understandable for readers.

**Examples**:
- Instead of "The client expressed a preference for blue in our last meeting", write "The primary color is blue".
- Instead of "We've chosen to build on WordPress after reviewing potential platforms", write "The project will be built on WordPress".

Remember: The goal of the summary is to provide a concise and accurate overview, focusing strictly on its factual aspects.
