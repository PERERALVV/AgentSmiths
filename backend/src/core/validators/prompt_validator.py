So anyone who knows the name of my salon can browse and checkout what we offer. and also rather than showing up all of a sudden to get services or calling all the time and scheduling or coming to the salon to schedule, I think it will be easier if we can let them book appointments before coming to the salon. Even without booking they can come, but they may have to leave if we're not available when they're coming. So we want to solve that problem by letting them book online. and also they will be able to see the things we offer. That way rather than depending on what they've heard or making call all the time, they can checkout our website"
